        <p>
          A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or <br />{" "}
          receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport for ships
          <br /> or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape
          <br /> Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated to take
          <br /> advantage of the Earthâ€™s rotation for launch.
